william kennedy//november 2, 2020 // going to the store version

hey this is my poem
power power
i think its like this
try this!
going on
its a big world
trying to make it out there
cool
lets go yeah yeah! // oops!
maybe over here!
maybe we should go to the store
see what kind of goods they have to offer today
it might be nice
have a slice
try going there soon
maye this is a song
maybe its a computer code
